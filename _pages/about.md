Hi, Iâ€™m **Kacper KapuÅ›niak**, a 2nd-year PhD student in **Machine Learning** at the **University of Oxford**, in [Prof. Michael Bronsteinâ€™s group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/).

My research focuses on **generative AI methods**, **geometric deep learning**, and their **applications in chemistry and biology**.

From September 2024 until May 2025, I interned with **Valence Labs**, where I worked on *flow matching for molecular dynamics*.  
The results of this work are available in the [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24779).

I hold an **MSc in Data Science** from **ETH ZÃ¼rich** and a BEng in Electrical Engineering from UCL.
