Hi!  

Iâ€™m **Kacper KapuÅ›niak**, a second-year **PhD student in Machine Learning** at the **University of Oxford**, supervised by [Professor Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/). My research focuses on **generative AI methods**, **geometric deep learning**, and their **applications in chemistry and biology**.  

From September 2024 to May 2025, I interned at [Valence Labs](https://www.valencelabs.com), where I worked on *flow matching for molecular dynamics* and improving diversity of generated molecules.  

Before Oxford, I completed an **MSc in Data Science** at **ETH ZÃ¼rich**, where my thesis explored **self-supervised graph neural network approaches**. I also hold a BEng in Electrical Engineering from **UCL**. Along the way, I have interned in **software engineering**, including **machine learning engineering** at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai).
